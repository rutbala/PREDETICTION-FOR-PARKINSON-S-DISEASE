# PREDETICTION-FOR-PARKINSON-S-DISEASE | Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, Python 

Introduction:-

This project presents a machine learning model for predicting Parkinson's disease (PD) using a comprehensive dataset that includes clinical, demographic, and symptom data. After preprocessing, feature selection identifies key predictors. SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are used for classification, with the model optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The model is validated for accuracy and generalizability, showing strong potential as a reliable tool for PD prediction. 

Modules:-

1. SVM (Support Vector Machine): A supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes in classification tasks.

2. Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification and regression accuracy.

3. Decision Tree: A model that splits data into branches based on feature values, used for decision-making in classification and regression.

4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A classification algorithm that assigns labels based on the closest 'k' training examples.

5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming a Gaussian distribution of features.
